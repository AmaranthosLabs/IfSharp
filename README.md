# IfSharp, Jupyter and F# Azure Notebooks

This is the F# implementation for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). View the [Feature Notebook](FSharp_Jupyter_Notebooks.ipynb) for some of the features that are included.

You can use Jupyter F# Notebooks for free (with free server-side execution) at [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/). If you select "Show me some samples", then there is an "Introduction to F#" which guides you through the language and its use in Jupyter.

# Compatibility
IfSharp supports Jupyter 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 and works with both Python 2.X and Python 3.X

If you need IPython 1.x or 2.x support please see the archived https://github.com/fsprojects/IfSharp/tree/ipython-archive

# Automatic Installation
Previous releases for the IPython notebook are here: [release repository](https://github.com/fsprojects/IfSharp/releases).
Automatic installs for Jupyter will be provided in the future.

# Running inside a Docker container
There is a Docker file for running the F# kernel v. 3.0.0-alpha in a container.
Build the container with: 

`docker build -t ifsharp:3.0.0-alpha .`

Run it with:

`docker run -d -v your_local_notebooks_dir:/notebooks -p your_port:8888 ifsharp:3.0.0-alpha`

The container exposes a volume called `notebooks` where the files get saved. On Linux, connect to the notebook on `http://localhost:your_port` and, on Windows, use `http://your_docker_machine:your_port`.

# Manual Installation (Windows)
1. Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
2. Install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)
3. Download current zip release [v3.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/fsprojects/IfSharp/releases/download/v3.0.0-beta1/IfSharp.v3.0.0-beta1.zip)
4. Run IfSharp.exe

Jupyter with IfSharp can be run via "jupyter notebook" in future

# Manual Installation (Mac)
1. Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
2. Install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)
3. Install [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) (tested 4.2.4)
3. Download current zip release [v3.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/fsprojects/IfSharp/releases/download/v3.0.0-beta1/IfSharp.v3.0.0-beta1.zip)
4. Unzip the release then run `mono IfSharp.exe`
5. (workaround: Copy ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/ifsharp to /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/ifsharp)
6. Run `jupyter notebook`

The workaround is for IPython/Jupyter changes will be fixed in a future release.

# Manual Installation (Linux)
1. Install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) via pip or Anaconda etc.
2. Install [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/) (tested 4.2.4) and F# (tested 4.0). (warning: Mono 4.6 does *not* work due to a [networking bug](https://github.com/fsprojects/IfSharp/issues/90) which is addressed in the upcoming Mono 4.8)
3. Download the current IfSharp zip release [v3.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/fsprojects/IfSharp/releases/download/v3.0.0-alpha4/IfSharp.v3.0.0-beta1.zip)
4. Unzip the release to a safe place such as `~/opt/ifsharp`.
5. Run `mono ~/opt/ifsharp/IfSharp.exe` to set up the jupyter config files in `~/.jupyter/` and `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/ifsharp/`.
  1. (For XPlot) From the install directory `~/opt/` run `mono paket.bootstrapper.exe` then `mono paket.exe install` 
6. Run `jupyter notebook`, the IfSharp kernel should now be one of the supported kernel types.
